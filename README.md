This is my first HTML/CSS project as part of The Odin Project.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Once I have completed the project satisfactorily, I will come back here and list the skills that I have learned.

Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
